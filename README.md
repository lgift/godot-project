Welcome to this lovely and beautiful game! To play, you simply play as a crucified Pomni (from the hit movie the amazing digital circus - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwAPLk_sQ3w), and have to carefully avoid the flying stairs that are bombarding you and will kill you on its touch.

Be aware of the pesky pop up ads too! This game is meant to be as overstimulating as possiible, so on top of the 15 videos that will be playing at the same time, there will be random pop up ads that will appear that you quickly have to click off of so that they don't block your view.

Good luck!
